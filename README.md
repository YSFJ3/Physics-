**Description:** This folder contains projects completed for coding modules undertaken in my Physics undergraduate degree at the Univeristy of Manchester.

## bouncy_ball_1st_assignment

•	Four-week project carried out using Python. A simulation of a bouncy ball is coded where the number of bounces under some initial conditions defined by the user was returned. 

## doppler_spectroscopy_assignment

•	Four-week project carried out using Python. Experimental data of the variation of light emitted from a star over several years was analysed in python. The mass of the star was found along with uncertainties. 
•	This project involvs cleaning the data using Numpy, implementing useful functions, calculating chi-squared and producing 3D plots for uncertainty calculations and adhering to proper coding style.

## drop_spreading_law 

•	Two-week project carried out using Jupyter Notebook. Modelled a liquid drop on a thin film using different spreading laws. These include the Cox-Voinov law and the De-Gennes law. The models were checked against experimental data and a chi-squared analysis was used to see which method fitted best.
•	This project involved cleaning the data using Numpy, implementing useful functions, calculating chi-squared for uncertainty calculations, and adhering to proper coding style.

## numerical_integration_damped_harmonic_oscillator
•	Five-week project carried out using Jupyter Notebook.  The oscillation of a mass connected to a spring was modelled. Four main methods were coded, Euler, Improved Euler, Verlet and Euler-Cromer. The errors in these methods were found and the displacement of the spring under different conditions was simulated. 
•	As an extra the Rung-Kutta 4th order method was coded, and phase plots were produced under different conditions. 

## simulating_thermal_neutrons

•	Five-week project carried out using Jupyter Notebook.  Neutrons approaching a slab of material were simulated using the Monte-Carlo method. A complete simulation was coded from scratch. The number of neutrons transmitted, scattered, and absorbed were found for three different materials, water, lead and graphite along with their associated uncertainties. Plots of the random walks of neutrons was produced.
•	As an extra the Woodcock method was coded. This involves the simulation of neutrons through two slabs of material connected to each other.

## AC_circuit

•	6 week project carried out in C++. In this project, an AC analogue circuit was simulated which could contain capacitors, resistors, or inductors. Classes were made for each of these components and various member functions were implemented. These components are either ideal or real where parasitic effects need to be included. The components can be added in series or parallel and the impedance of each component and the total circuit is calculated. 
• The user also has the option to add additional circuits to a circuit library. These circuits can then be added together in series and the total impedance of this system will be calculated. In addition, the phase shift and magnitude of impedance can be printed.
